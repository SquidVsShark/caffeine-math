This is a header only math library that built up in my hobby projects. I've extracted it and put it up here for anybody who wants it use it. Its a no-nonsense floating point math library.


## Support For
floating point vector types (2,3 and 4), floating point matrix types (3x3 and 4x4), floating point quaternion type, and some general math operations.


## SIMD Status
There is no SIMD support currently, I have been working on it a little, but its not a priority for me right now because I have no math bottlenecks. However the library has been designed around a SIMD implimentation so when it comes there should be minimal fuss.
